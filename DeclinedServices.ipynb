    "For declined services, we will use a list of \"trigger\" words to determine whether a service has been declined or not. The words \"decline\" and \"declined\" do not suffice to categorize a comment as either being declined or not. More trigger words are needed. Regexp will not be needed as in the previous version since Python can detect partial substrings. For example, if we were to search for the word \"declined,\" but the comment included \"declined|\", Python will still detect the word, as shown below."
