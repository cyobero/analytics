    "[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) is a collection of mathematical and computational problems that serves as an  extremely useful resource to test and improve your both your problem solving and coding abilities. The site is composed of different mathematical problems and tests your ability to come up with a solution using the programming language of your choice. I absolutely love the site. Here are just a few of the relatively easier problems. \n",

    "It's important to note that Project Euler isn't so much concerned about how long it takes you to develop your algorithm, or even how elegant it is. Each problem is designed according to the \"one-minute rule,\" meaning that regardless of your algorithm, you should be able to solve the problem on a modestly powerful computer within one minute or less. \n",

If you need a refresher, the least common multiple between two numbers is the smallest number (greater than 0) that is a multiple of both numbers. That is, given two numbers $a$ and $b$, the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$ is the smallest number that can be evenly divided by both $a$ and $b$. For example, the least common multiple of 6 and 4 is 12, since $\\frac{12}{6}=2$ and $\\frac{12}{4}=3$. \n",

Thus, 2, 5, and 7 are all prime numbers since for each of those numbers, the only factors are 2 and 1, 5 and 1, and 7 and 1. A **composite** number is the opposite of a prime number in that it is a number that has factors beyond itself and 1. That it is, it can be evenly divided by another number besides 1 and itself. An example would be 10 and 36. 10 has factors of 1, 2, 5, and 10. 36 has factors of 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, and 6. Multiplying all prime factors will result in the original number.
